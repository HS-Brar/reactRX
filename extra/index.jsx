In my current role, I independently manage the front end for the RxAudit project, utilizing the latest technologies to enhance user experience. I also contribute to backend development, ensuring seamless integration between both ends of the application. I oversee the complete development cycle, from initial design to end-to-end deployments. Recently, I was assigned as the Point of Contact (POC) for the RxAudit project, handling all technical and general queries, which has further strengthened my communication and leadership skills within the team.
